      "copy": "Simone remains one of the biggest stars on Vine, and it’s no wonder why. From her uncanny Beyonce impressions to original quips, she impresses talent and touch into each six-second clip. We wondered what would happen if the camera was on her even longer, so we started out with a series of Vines and expanded from there. When our initial collaborations verified her off-the-charts audience engagement, we decided to feature her on our Tawk show – and eventually developed a series with her center-stage.",

      "copy": "When we spotted Gabbie, we couldn’t help but fall in love with her refreshing, authentic sense of humor. We knew we wanted to collaborate with her, so we started out small: with a low-cost beta-test on Vine to refine a strategy before expanding to bigger series like ANXT on YouTube and videos on other platforms. Since then, she’s been featured in Vanity Fair, Business Insider, and starred in an original series on Verizon’s Go90 app.",
